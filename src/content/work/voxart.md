Recording and editing videos is a long process. In order to make it more accessible to those who want to make informational videos, I created a way to take a voice memo and generate a professional video from it. All you have to do is upload a voice memo and VoxArt will generate a video. This video will have subtitles generated along with pictures that it pulls based on what it detects that you are talking about.

This makes it effortless to create educational content or any content for that matter. All you need is your voice, a script and voila! you are a content creator
